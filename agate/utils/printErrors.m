function printErrors(CONFIG, divenums, pp)
%PRINTERRORS	print the non-zero Seaglider errors for some dive(s)
%
%   Syntax:
%       PRINTERRORS(CONFIG, divenums, pp)
%
%   Description:
%       In the MATLAB Command Window, print the non-zero errors encountered on
%       one or more dives in a user-readable way. If there were no errors on
%       a given dive, nothing is printed.
%
%   Inputs:
%       CONFIG      Mission/agate global configuration variable
%	divenums    Dive numbers to print errors for
%       pp	    Piloting parameters variable for some glider; should have at
%		    least as many rows as max(divenums)
%
%   Outputs:
%       no output; might print information
%
%   Examples:
%	printErrors(CONFIG, 17:19, pp639)         % print errors on dives 17-19
%	printErrors(CONFIG, size(pp639,1), pp639) % print errors on last dive
