Text from top of supplement file:

This file contains an updated version of the getBandTable.m function to offset the band frequencies by one half of a band when required by IEC 2014. It contains functions to compute hybrid millidecade band sound pressure levels and power spectral densities from an FFT and the band frequencies. At the end of this file is a script to exercise the functions.
