Initial development was for surveys using Seaglider platforms and either the Wideband Intelligent Signal Processor and Recorder (WISPR) or the Passive Miniaturized Acoustic Recorder XL (PMARXL) recording systems.\nNOAA’s Uncrewed Systems Operations Center (UxSOC) funded additional development into a more broadly applicable and user-friendly tool box that could be used by all interested in conducting glider-based passive acoustic surveys for marine mammals.\nReady? Get started\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Diagram showing the different components of agate. Tools can be broken up into two main categories: piloting tools, which are used for survey planning and execution, and processing tools which are used in post-mission analyses. The processing tools can further be broken up into flight, acoustic, and cetacean encounter processing tools. The cetacean encounter processing tools can incorporate externally identified cetacean detections (white balloon) or process on-board detections if available.",

The smaller the area extracted, the faster it will load and plot.\nLower resolution may be sufficient for post-mission plotting. The global 60 arc second tiff is a good mid-resolution option that is easy, although slow, to download, import, and plot. Alternatively, 60 arc second resolution for just a specific area of interest can be extracted with the ETOPO Grid Extract tool providing a smaller file size and faster loading/plotting.",

All conversion code is located in the agate\\convertAcoustics folder.\nAdditionally, following a mission in Spring 2023, a bug in the WISPR firmware was discovered that led to variable gain over the duration of the deployment.

    "section": "Fix WISPR gain bug",
    "text": "Fix WISPR gain bug\nA bug was discovered in WISPR in spring 2023 (should be fixed now??) that leads to sound recordings that look like they have variable gain settings applied on different files. One file would be half as loud as the next (6 dB gain change). For more info on the source/issue with this bug, contact Chris Jones. An imperfect, but workable fix was developed with C. Jones and is included here just in case someone else would find it useful or if the issue arises again in the future. Because this is hopefully one-off issue, the below instructions are an outline/draft of documentation and the included code is not generalized (e.g., hard coded paths, etc.) and is meant to guide a similar effort. Please reach out if you encounter the same problem or need further assistance.\nThis process assumes you have initially converted the .dat files to .wavs, and in looking at those .wavs, noticed an issue. Those ‘bad’ .wavs will be used to make decisions about file gain adjustments so those need to be retained. Then, this process will reconvert the .dat files into .wavs, making adjustments to the expected gain if needed, as assessed following a set of rules or according to manual user input.\nThe general workflow was to work on one dive’s worth of files at a time. That dive’s ‘bad’ .wav files would be opened in Raven so the spectrograms could be visually compared. Jumps in gain are vary obvious as stark changes in noise level from one file to the next. Quieter files are gain settings of ‘1’ and are not changed. The louder files are assumed to have a gain setting of ‘2’ and are reduced to align more with the quieter files.\nA MATLAB script is run for that dive’s worth of files, where .dat files are read in and the noise levels in a specified band are compared. If they are within a similar level, then the gain is assumed to not change and the files are written to .wav as is. If the second file is louder, then it’s gain is adjusted down and this adjusted file is written to .wav format. There are special catches in the script for instances where the noise level between the two files is not a clear 1:1 or 1:2 ratio. In those cases, the script prompts the user to manually assess and specify an adjustment. The user can use the script-generated plots and the spectrograms of the ‘bad’ files to make this decision.\nAll code needed to apply the fix is located in the agate\\convertAcoustics\\fixWispr folder.\n\nIncluded files\nfix_gain.m: This is the primary script to apply the fix. The user must update a few paths and settings and then run this script on a folder of acoustic files. More on running it below\nmy_psd.m: Function to calculate power spectral densities. Results are similar to pwelch but provides outputs normalized by frequency bin size\nplotRMSSpec.m: Function to plot RMS level for two files being compared\nread_wispr_file.m: Function to read a raw WISPR .dat file, extracting all included header info\n\n\nRunning fix_gain\n\nSet up data to be processed\nThe fix_gain script is meant to be run over a folder of files. Depending on deployment length, it may be beneficial to work in smaller batches of files. For example, for a 5 week glider mission, we had 40k files which was unreasonable to work with all at once. Plus, when the glider was at the surface there were short gaps in time and so comparing noise levels of files across that time gap may not be appropriate. We found that working on a folder of just the files for a single dive at a time worked well. You could use a different approach but it would require reworking the paths in this script.\nCreate a ‘working’ folder where you will incrementally move the .dat files for just a single dive, process those, then move them out of that folder and replace with the files for the next dive.\nLoad the dive’s worth of ‘bad’ .wavs into Raven (use the Page option to load large amounts of data without crashing Raven) to view the spectrograms in cases where manual assessment is needed.\n\n\nSet paths and other settings\nWithin the script, several lines of code will need to be changed for your local paths and settings preferences.\n\nLine 48: Specify path to agate folder so all required functions are added to the path\nLine 54: Set verbose to either 'true' or 'false'\n\nverbose = 'true': All prompts and all plots will be generated. The user will need to manually click through every file comparison. This is very useful when first fixing this problem to get a feel for how the files compare, but is time consuming. It is also useful in time periods with a lot of animal noise that could lead to incorrect assumptions of gain changes.\nverbose = 'false': Plots and prompts only appear if a non-standard gain adjustment is detected (not 1 or 2). This enables the script to run mostly hands off except in cases that aren’t clear\n\nLine 57: Set fldrStr to the folder where the dive full of files to be processed will be temporarily moved for processing\nLine 58: Set dive to the dive number to be processed. This is just used in naming the output log files\nLine 59: Set phase to both, ascent, or descent, depending on how many files are being processed. Working on phases individually means more manual moving of files but allows a bit more checking in on the process as it works in smaller chunks\nLine 60: Set path_dat to the folder containing the .dat files to be processed, the temporary ‘working folder’\nLine 61: Set path_out to the overall output folder where the log files and processed .wav files should be saved\nLine 62: Set path_wav for the subfolder (within path_out) to save this dive’s processed files. I had this also print to a ‘working’ folder and then after each dive was processed and those files were checked (viewed in Raven), then they were manually moved out of the working folder into a ‘complete’ folder\nLine 71: Set adc_vref. Default for WISPR is 5\nLine 72: Set nbufs to specify number of buffers to compare (from end of first file to start of second file). For our recording settings, a buffer was 5632 samples, sample rate was 180 kHz, so 96 buffers is just over 3 seconds\nLine 73: Set max_thresh to remove spikes in waveform that could skew the RMS calculations. This is adaptive, so if it is set at 1 and that removes too many datapoints, the process will try to incrementally increase it. This is necessary for periods of glider pumping which are all very loud Lines 78:79, 81: Set spectrum parameters to provide reasonable resolution for a given sampling rate. Larger fft_size will give finer resolution but may lead to ‘spiky’ spectra that aren’t good for comparison\nLines 84:85: Set frequency range (f1 lower limit, f2 upper limit) to compare. Ideal is to select a frequency range a lot of animal or anthropogenic (intermittent/variable) sounds would not be present\n\nThe remaining lines set up the log file, so don’t need to be changed unless the user wants additional information printed out\n\n\nRun the script\nHit the green Run button and interact with the script in the Command Window.\nAt the start of a folder, the gain settings for the first two files must always be manually entered, to set the baseline. Use Raven to compare these two files to each other and later files to assess if they are a ‘1’ or ‘2’ (or a combination of those) and manually enter the correct settings.\nAt each prompt, the number should be typed in the command window followed by hitting Enter. The suggested value is in square brackets, but can be confusing/unreliable for the first two files so isn’t necessarily correct. To just accept the suggested value, just hit Enter without typing in new number.\nThe only valid inputs should be ‘1’ or ‘2’. Values that are not one of these will prompt for user assessment.\nIn periods with a lot of dolphins, the script may get confused (noise levels in subsequent 3 seconds can be very different!) so those may require lots of manual assessment.\nIf a wrong key is accidentally pressed or a mistake is made, the best approach is to Quit at the next available prompt. Navigate to the log files and rename them with ‘part1’ or something similar. Move the .dat files that were correctly processed out of the working folder, and then re-run the reduced working folder. This will create new log files at this new starting location, and will overwrite any incorrectly adjusted .wavs. A record of what was adjusted for the earlier files will be saved in the original logs with the appended names.\nBack to top",

    "text": "Quick Start Guide\n\nCreate configuration files\nRunning agate requires a few configuration files. Both of these are plain text files that end with .cnf and can be edited in any text editor or in MATLAB’s Editor window\n\nAn overview mission configuration file for a specific glider/mission\nA basestation configuration file with SSH login info\n\n\nMission configuration file\nAn example configuration file is located in the agate/settings folder: agate_config_example.cnf\nThe configuration file has settings for the glider and mission, paths to relevant input and output folders, map extent and plotting settings, and acoustic system settings. The top section is required to initialize agate and use the most basic functions. The remaining sections are optional depending on what agate functionality is desired. Make a copy and save this file with a unique name for each glider and mission. Descriptions of each configuration item are included in the example file as comments that start with %.\nAdditional info on setting up configuration files can be found in the Configuration file guide.\nTo suggest additional configuration items, please open an issue.\n\n\nBasestation configuration file\nThe path and filename for a basestation configuration file is specified in the mission configuration file. An example is located in the agate/settings folder: basestation_example.cnf.\nThis is a separate configuration file that typically does not change between missions and gliders, and contains potentially sensitive information for the SSH connection to a research group’s basestation. This file should be stored somewhere central and safe, preferably outside of the GitHub repository for security reasons.\nAdditional info on setting up configuration files can be found in the Configuration file guide.\nBack to top\n\n\n\nSet up folder structure\nThe suggested folder structure for working with agate is to specify a ‘mission’ folder, and then within that have a standardized set of nested folders for the various agate inputs and outputs. The path of the ‘mission’ folder is specified by CONFIG.path.mission in the mission configuration file and typically follows the Seaglider naming scheme (e.g., C:\\Users\\User.Name\\Desktop\\sg###_Location_MonYYYY).\nWithin that, should be a flightStatus and a basestationFiles folder; flightStatus will house output figures and tables, and basestationFiles is where downloaded basestation files will be saved.\nThese folders can be set up manually, or created in MATLAB:\n% specify the local piloting folder for this trip\npath_status = fullfile(CONFIG.path.mission, 'flightStatus'); % where to store status outputs \npath_bsLocal = fullfile(CONFIG.path.mission, 'basestationFiles'); % local copy of basestation files\n\n% make the dirs if they don't exist\nmkdir(path_status);\nmkdir(path_bsLocal);\nBack to top\n\n\nInitialize agate\n\nOpen MATLAB\nAdd the agate folder to the path (with subfolders), if not already done\nType CONFIG = agate(&lt;agate_config.cnf&gt;); in the command window and hit enter\n\nReplace &lt;agate_config.cnf&gt; with the name of your configuration file (e.g., 'agate_config_sg639_MHI_Apr2022.cnf')\nIf the configuration file is located within the agate/settings folder, just the name is sufficient. If it is located elsewhere, specify the fullfile path (e.g., 'C:/Users/User.Name/Desktop/agate_config_sgXXX.cnf')\n\nAlternatively, simply type CONFIG = agate; and you will be prompted to select a configuration file\n\n% make sure the agate folder has been added to the path!\n\n% initialize by specifying the configuration file\nCONFIG = agate('agate_config.cnf');\n\n% OR intialize and select the configuration file\nCONFIG = agate;\nBack to top\n\n\nDownload all basestation files\nUse downloadBasestationFiles to automatically download various basestation files to a local machine for further examination. This function requires both a mission configuration file and a basestation configuration file that contains the host url, username, and either a password or paths to an SSH key pair.\nBelow is example code to run this step.

Use doc plotTrackBathyProfile to see all possible arguments.\n% can specify bathymetry file\nbathyFile = 'C:\\GIS\\etopo\\ETOPO2022_bedrock_30arcsec_MHI.tiff';\nplotTrackBathyProfile(CONFIG, 'targetsFile', targetsFile, 'bathyFile', bathyFile)\n% OR \n% leave empty to prompt to select files\nplotTrackBathyProfile(CONFIG)\n\n% save as .png\nexportgraphics(gcf, fullfile(CONFIG.path.mission, [CONFIG.glider '_' ...\n    CONFIG.mission, '_targetsBathymetryProfile_' targetsName, '.png']), ...\n    'Resolution', 300)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Bathymetry profile for set targets file which shows the seafloor depth at each target and in the straight line between each target. The 990 m depth limit is marked with a dashed line.\n\n\n\n\n\nSummarize planned track\nThe below code reads in an existing (or newly created!) targets file and will loop through to calculate the distance between each waypoint and then print out the total planned track distance.

    "text": "This page is meant to demonstrate some suggested workflows and examples of how the piloting functions may be used in an active mission to help the pilot download basestation files, create monitoring plots, and monitor mission progress.\nAll code on this page combined in the workflow_downloadScript.m in the agate\\example_workflows folder.\nDetails for each piloting function (inputs, outputs, etc) are available within the standard MATLAB-type documentation in the header of each function and include a detailed description, info on input and output arguments, and examples. These details can be pulled up by typing doc function or help function within the MATLAB Command Window.\n\nInitialization\nTo run any of the agate functions, the toolbox must be initialized with a configuration file.\nNo configuration file yet? Go to the Configuration Guide. If agate will be used to download files from the basestation to the local computer, a basestation.cnf file is required and the OPTIONAL - working with the basestation section of the mission configuration file must be completed.\nThe examples on this page include some plotting, so the OPTIONAL - plotting section should be complete. Examples below will also include some outputs for both the PMAR (pm) and WISPR (ws) acoustic systems. Those are specified in the configuration file and the examples below will indicate which system is ‘active’ for each example. This is controlled with the CONFIG.pm.loggers and CONFIG.ws.loggers options in the OPTIONAL - acoustics section of the configuration file.\n% !make sure agate is on the path!\n\n% initialize with specified configuration file, 'agate_config.cnf'\nCONFIG = agate(agate_config.cnf);\n\n% OR\n\n% initialize with prompt to select configuration file\nCONFIG = agate;\nBack to top\n\n\nDownloading files from the basestation\nagate can use SSH to automatically download any new files present on the basestation to a local computer for further processing. The below folder structure is the suggested approach for working with agate and will ensure later functions are looking in the right spots. It may be possible to customize the folder structure but may result in bugs; if that happens, please report them and we can try to fix it!\n% specify the local piloting folder for this trip in CONFIG.path.mission\n% set up nested folders for basestation files and piloting outputs\npath_status = fullfile(CONFIG.path.mission, 'flightStatus'); % where to store output plots/tables\npath_bsLocal = fullfile(CONFIG.path.mission, 'basestationFiles'); % local copy of basestation files\n% make the dirs if they don't exist\nmkdir(path_status);\nmkdir(path_bsLocal);\n\n% download basestation files\ndownloadBasetationFiles(CONFIG, path_bsLocal)\nBack to top\n\n\nCreating a piloting parameters (pp) variable\nMany of the plotting and other piloting-related functions within agate rely on a pp (piloting parameters) variable - a large table with various outputs from the .nc and .log files compiled in one place. Use the extractPilotingParams to create this table.\nThe last argument, preload, is used to specify if the table should be made from scratch (does not load any previously created table), or if a previous table should be loaded and any new dives appended to that table. As more dives occur during a mission, creating a new table each time can get slow, so saving the previous table and setting preload to 1 can save processing time. If the piloting parameters table is saved in the default location shown in the save() step below, then it will be loaded automatically. If it is saved elsewhere, the function will prompt to select the correct .mat to load.\n% create piloting parameters (pp) table from downloaded basestation files\npp = extractPilotingParams(CONFIG, fullfile(CONFIG.path.mission, 'basestationFiles'), ...\nfullfile(CONFIG.path.mission, 'flightStatus'), 0);\n% change last argument from 0 to 1 to load existing data and append new dives/rows\n\n% save it to the default location\nsave(fullfile(CONFIG.path.mission, 'flightStatus', ['diveTracking_' CONFIG.glider '.mat']), 'pp');\nBack to top\n\n\nMid-mission plots\nFor detail on all available plotting functions, see the Plots page. A highlight of those most useful for piloting are below.\nThe below steps require a pp variable. If it was created already, this first step is not needed.\n% load existing pp table\nload(fullfile(CONFIG.path.mission, 'flightStatus', ['diveTracking_' CONFIG.glider '.mat']))\n\nMap\n…with target waypoints, dives completed thus far, and vector arrows for the currents.\nIn this example, bathymetry is plotted, specified by CONFIG.map.bathyFile. That last argument can be left out to not plot bathymetry (which can be slow depending on the resolution of the selected bathymetry raster). If the last argument is set to 1, a prompt will appear to select the correct bathymetry file.\nThe below example code saves the map both as a .fig file and a .png. The .fig version will be a very large file, if bathymetry is included, but it is useful for reopening in MATLAB and being able to zoom and move around in the plot. The .png is good for a quick easy overview and ease of sharing, but doesn’t allow the interactive zooming that a pilot may need.\nHigh resolution bathymetry TIFF files can be downloaded from NCEI. See Dependecies - Basemap rasters for more info on how to select and download bathymetry rasters.\n% print map **SLOWISH** - figNumList(1)\ntargetsFile = fullfile(CONFIG.path.mission, 'targets');\nplotGliderPath_etopo(CONFIG, pp, targetsFile, CONFIG.map.bathyFile);\n\n% save it as a .fig (for zooming)\nsavefig(fullfile(path_status, [CONFIG.glider '_map.fig']))\n% and as a .png (for quick/easy view)\nexportgraphics(gca, fullfile(path_status, [CONFIG.glider '_map.png']), ...\n    'Resolution', 300)\nBack to top\n\n\nMonitoring plots\n…for humidity, internal pressure, battery consumption, power draw, and acoustic system status.\nIndividual pilots may find some or all or none of these plots useful, but here are just a few examples. The example code has the option to save the figures with the print() function, but that is optional. To automatically plot, save, and then close the figures, just add a close command after print (see example with third and fifth plots below).\n% humidity and pressure - figNumList(2)\nplotHumidityPressure(CONFIG, pp)\nprint(fullfile(path_status, [CONFIG.glider  '_humidityPressure.png']), '-dpng')\n\n% battery usage/free space - figNumList(3)\nplotBattUseFreeSpace(CONFIG, pp, 310)\nprint(fullfile(path_status, [CONFIG.glider '_battUseFreeSpace.png']), '-dpng')\n\n% voltage pack use (power draw by device) - figNumList(4)\nplotVoltagePackUse(CONFIG, pp)\nprint(fullfile(path_status, [CONFIG.glider '_usageByDevice.png']), '-dpng')\nclose \n\n% voltage pack use (power draw by device, normalized by dive duration) - figNumList(5)\nplotVoltagePackUse_norm(CONFIG, pp)\nprint(fullfile(path_status, [CONFIG.glider '_usageByDevice_normalized_.png']), '-dpng')\n\n% minimum reported voltages - figNumList(6)\nplotMinVolt(CONFIG, pp)\nprint(fullfile(path_status, [CONFIG.glider '_minimumVoltage.png']), '-dpng')\n% close\nIf the glider is running a PMAR acoustic system (and CONFIG.pm.loggers = 1 is set in the configuration file), the free space remaining on each SD card will be plotted by plotBattUseFreeSpace. Additionally, storage space used per minute, by dive, and over time can be plotted with plotPmUsed:\n% PMAR space used per minute and over time\nplotPmUsed(CONFIG, pp)\nIf the glider is running a WISPR acoustic system (and CONFIG.ws.loggers = 1 is set in the configuration file), and using the on-board ERMA sperm whale detector, detection events can be plotted for a single dive. The plots show ICI (inter-click-interval) over the event duration and as a histogram. This plot is interactive and allows the user to click backwards through previous dives; a specific dive can be specified in the function call or end can be used to plot the most recent dive. The plot also provides a ‘reference plot’ showing what a true detection event of both a group of sperm whales or an individual sperm whale would look like. This plot can be used by the pilot to compare and validate the incoming detections.\n% plot detection events from the most recent dive\nplotErmaDetections(CONFIG, path_bsLocal, pp.diveNum(end))\nBack to top\n\n\n\nPrinting errors and mission speed and duration information\nThe Seaglider .log file provides a summary of any errors that occurred during each dive, but they are just a list of integers that then have to be compared to a manual (and differ by Rev B vs Rev E!) so there is a function to print out all non-zero errors and a short descriptor of the type. Any dive can be specified in the second argument, or just the most recent dive as shown below.\n% print out errors with info on type, for the most recent dive\nprintErrors(CONFIG, size(pp,1), pp)\nThe printTravelMetrics and printRecoveryMetrics functions calculate several summary values for the glider’s average speed, progress along the trackline, and estimated time of arrival at the recovery point (last waypoint in targets file). These outputs can be printed to the MATLAB Command Window if the last argument is set to 1, otherwise they will be stored in a structure tm.\n% print avg speed and rough estimate of total mission duration\ntm = printTravelMetrics(CONFIG, pp, fullfile(CONFIG.path.mission, 'targets'), 1);\n\n% specify planned recovery date and time\nrecovery = '2023-06-05 19:00:00';\nrecTZ = 'Pacific/Honolulu';\ntm = printRecoveryMetrics(CONFIG, pp, fullfile(CONFIG.path.mission, 'targets'), ...\nrecovery, recTZ, 1);\nBack to top",
