    "text": "A collection of tools to be used for piloting acoustic gliders, processing glider positional and environmental data, and analyzing glider-collected acoustic data for surveys of marine mammals.\nThis is the public release version and it is very much under development.\n Last Update: 21 Apr 2023\n\n\nThese tools were initially developed for use with passive acoustic glider surveys conducted by the OSU/NOAA CIMERS Bioacoustics Lab bioacoustics.us and as part of my PhD. Initial development was for surveys using Seaglider platforms and either the Wideband Intelligent Signal Processor and Recorder (WISPR) or PMAR-XL recording systems.\nThrough NOAA’s Uncrewed Systems Initiative (UxS) we received funding to develop and improve these tools into a more broadly applicable and user-friendly tool box that could be used by all interested in conducting glider-based passive acoustic surveys for marine mammals.\nReady? Get started\nPlease contact me if you have any questions, feedback, or suggestions!\nselene [dot] fregosi [at] noaa.gov or Report an issue on GitHub\n\n\n\nFigure 1: diagram showing the different components of agate\n\n\n\n\n\nMatlab toolboxes:\n\nMapping Toolbox\n\nagate requires the Matlab Mapping toolbox. In the future, we may try modify the mapping tools to work with the freely available m_map package to make it more accessible, but are not there yet!\n\n\nThis package requires a few resources from Matlab File Exchange. They come packaged within the utils/fileExchange folder. More info about each can be found below:\n\nSSH/SFTP/SCP For Matlab (v2)\nLatLon Distance\nhline and vline\ncmocean\n\nBasemap rasters:\nA raster file is needed to plot bathymetry data on any of the maps. Detailed basemaps are available from NCEI.\nDepending on the needed resolution, the 60 arc second .tiff file may be sufficient, and is a reasonable size for download and plotting, but is a bit slow to load. Alternatively, finer resolution (15-60 arc second resolution options) for the specific area of interest can be extracted using the ETOPO Grid Extract tool to download .tiff files in a smaller file size for faster loading and plotting.\n\n\n\nThe scientific results and conclusions, as well as any views or opinions expressed herein, are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of NOAA or the Department of Commerce.\nThis repository is a scientific product and is not official communication of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or the United States Department of Commerce.

    "text": "Quick Start Guide\n\nCreate configuration files\nRunning agate requires a few configuration files. Both of these are plain text files that end with .cnf and can be edited in any text editor or in MATLAB’s Editor window\n\nAn overview mission configuration file for a specific glider/mission\nA basestation configuration file with SSH login info\n\n\nMission configuration file\nAn example configuration file is located in the ‘agate/settings’ folder: agate_config_example.cnf\nStart any comment lines with %. It has settings for the glider and mission, paths to relevant input and output folders, map extent and plotting settings, and acoustic system settings. Save this file with a unique name for each glider and mission. Descriptions of each configuration item are included in the example file as comments.\nTo suggest additional configuration items, please open an issue.\n\n\nBasestation configuration file\nThe path and filename for basestation configuration file is specified in the mission configuration file. An example is located in the ‘agate/settings’ folder: basestation.cnf.\nThis is a separate configuration file that typically does not change between missions and gliders, and contains potentially sensitive information for the SSH connection to a research group’s basestation. This file should be stored somewhere central and safe, preferably outside of the GitHub repository for security reasons. This file must contain the following lines, with the inputs updated for a particular basestation:\nCONFIG.bs.host = 'url.com';\nCONFIG.bs.username = 'pilot';\nCONFIG.bs.password = 'PsWrD';\nBack to top\n\n\n\nSet up folder structure\nThe suggested folder structure for working with agate is to specify a ‘mission’ folder, and then within that have a standardized set of nested folders for the various agate inputs and outputs. The path of the ‘mission’ folder is specified by CONFIG.path.mission in the mission configuration file and typically follows the Seaglider naming scheme (e.g., C:\\Users\\User.Name\\Desktop\\sg###_Location_MonYYYY).\nWithin that, should be a ‘flightStatus’ and a ‘basestationFiles’ folder; ‘flightStatus’ will house output figures and tables, and ‘basestationFiles’ is where downloaded basestation files will be saved.\nThese folders can be set up manually, or created in MATLAB:\n% specify the local piloting folder for this trip\npath_status = fullfile(CONFIG.path.mission, 'flightStatus'); % where to store status outputs \npath_bsLocal = fullfile(CONFIG.path.mission, 'basestationFiles'); % local copy of basestation files\n\n% make the dirs if they don't exist\nmkdir(path_status);\nmkdir(path_bsLocal);\nBack to top\n\n\nInitialize agate\n\nOpen MATLAB\nAdd agate to the path (with subfolders), if not already done\nType agate agate_config.cnf in the command window and hit enter\n\nreplace agate_config.cnf with the name of your configuration file (e.g., agate_config_sg639_MHI_Apr2022.cnf)\n\nAlternatively, simply type agate and you will be prompted to select a configuration file\n\nBack to top\n\n\nDownload all basestation files\nUse basestationFileExtract to automatically download various basestation files to a local machine for further examination.\nBelow is example code to run this step. This can be saved as a script that makes it easy to re-run each time the glider surfaces, or it can be typed directly into the MATLAB Command Window.\n% ensure agate folder is added to the matlab path before proceeding\n% initialize agate; will prompt for configuration file\nagate\n\n% load global configs\nglobal CONFIG\n\n% specify the local piloting folder for this trip\npath_status = fullfile(CONFIG.path.mission, 'flightStatus'); % where to store status outputs \npath_bsLocal = fullfile(CONFIG.path.mission, 'basestationFiles'); % local copy of basestation files\n% make the dirs if they don't exist\nmkdir(path_status);\nmkdir(path_bsLocal);\n\n% extract basestation files\nbasestationFileExtract(CONFIG, path_bslLocal)\nBack to top\n\n\nExtract select piloting parameters and flight metrics\n%% extract various piloting parameters and values reported by .log file\n\npp = extractPilotingParams(CONFIG, path_bsLocal, path_status);\n% print errors for quick glance/check\npp.ERRORS(end)\n\n% save as .xlsx and .mat \nwritetable(pp, fullfile(path_status, ['diveTracking_' CONFIG.glider '.xlsx'])); % local copy\nsave(fullfile(path_status, ['diveTracking_' CONFIG.glider '.mat']), 'pp');\n\nBack to top"
