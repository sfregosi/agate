This page is meant to help with __*agate*__ 'installation' on your MATLAB path and setting up the necessary configuration files and folder structure plus serve as a quick start guide for some basic commands. 

This page is not a detailed list of all available functions and their specific documentation (that might be coming later!). Those details are available within the standard MATLAB-type documentation in the header of each function and include a detailed description, info on input and output arguments, and examples. These details can be pulled up by typing `doc <function>` or `help <function>` in the MATLAB Command window,  replacing `<function>` with the actual name of the function. 

## Installation

*See the [Dependencies](https://sfregosi.github.io/agate/#dependencies) section of the home page for more info on the required Mathworks File Exchange packages (copies of these come packaged with __agate__) and MATLAB Toolbox requirements.*

- Download __*agate*__ from [GitHub](https://github.com/sfregosi/agate) 
  - **Option 1:** Download the latest release
    - This option ensures a stable release and removes the requirement of working with GitHub but will need manual updating
    - Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/sfregosi/agate/releases) page and download the latest release source code as a zip or tar.gz file 
    - Unzip the downloaded folder and place within the default MATLAB directory (*e.g.*, `C:\Users\User.Name\Documents\MATLAB\`). You only need the `agate` folder (the `docs` folder contains the files for this website so they can be deleted). 
  - **Option 2:** Clone the repository using GitHub or GitHub Desktop 
    - This package is actively being developed and the easiest way stay up to date with the latest improvements is to regularly check for updates from GitHub, but this comes with risks as it may be buggy
    - Click on the green *Code* button and select *Open with GitHub Desktop* 
    - Specify where to clone the cloned local copy. Suggest the default MATLAB directory (*e.g.*, `C:\Users\User.Name\Documents\MATLAB\`)
    - For more help with GitHub see this [Git Started Doc](https://github.com/PIFSC-Protected-Species-Division/PSDOS/blob/main/files/git_started.md)
  - **Option 3:** Fork the repository using GitHub, then clone your fork via the **Option 2** steps above
    - This is the best option if you would like to modify the tools and contribute to **agate** but also stay up to date with the latest developer changes
    - Click on the grey *Fork* button in the upper right and follow the prompts to create a copy of the repository in your personal GitHub account
    - Follow the **Option 2** steps to clone your fork to your local computer
    - In the future, use the *Sync fork* button on GitHub to update your fork with any changes in the main repository, while maintaining any of your own modification and use the *Contribute* button to create pull requests so contribute your modifications to the package
  - **Option 4:** Download the repository as a zip file
    - This provides the latest functionality before an official release and removes requirement of working with GitHub but will need manual updating
    - Click the green *Code* button at the landing page of the repository and choose *Download ZIP*
    - Unzip the downloaded folder and place within the default MATLAB directory (*e.g.*, `C:\Users\User.Name\Documents\MATLAB\`)
- Add __*agate*__ to the MATLAB path
  - Open MATLAB and click on *Set Path* in the Environment section of the Home tab (@fig-screenshot-matlab-setpath)
  - In the Set Path dialog box, choose *Add with Subfolders...*, select the `agate` folder, and click *Save*, then *Close* (@fig-screenshot-matlab-setpath-save)
  - This will now be saved for future MATLAB sessions, but would need to be repeated for any installation on a new computer

## Quick Start Guide

### Create configuration files

Running __*agate*__ requires a few configuration files. Both of these are plain text files that end with .cnf and can be edited in any text editor or in MATLAB's Editor window

1. An overview [mission configuration file](#mission-configuration-file) for a specific glider/mission
2. A [basestation configuration file](#basestation-configuration-file) with SSH login info

#### Mission configuration file

An example configuration file is located in the `agate/settings` folder: [`agate_config_example.cnf`](https://github.com/sfregosi/agate/blob/main/agate/settings/agate_config_example.cnf)

The configuration file has settings for the glider and mission, paths to relevant input and output folders, map extent and plotting settings, and acoustic system settings. The top section is required to initialize __*agate*__ and use the most basic functions. The remaining sections are optional depending on what __*agate*__ functionality is desired. Make a copy and save this file with a unique name for each glider and mission. Descriptions of each configuration item are included in the example file as comments that start with `%`. 

Additional info on setting up configuration files can be found in the [Configuration file guide](https://sfregosi.github.io/agate/configuration.html).

To suggest additional configuration items, please open an [issue](https://github.com/sfregosi/agate/issues/new){target='_blank'}.

#### Basestation configuration file

The path and filename for a basestation configuration file is specified in the mission configuration file. An example is located in the `agate/settings` folder: [`basestation_example.cnf`](https://github.com/sfregosi/agate/blob/main/agate/settings/basestation_example.cnf). 

This is a separate configuration file that typically does not change between missions and gliders, and contains potentially sensitive information for the SSH connection to a research group's basestation. *This file should be stored somewhere central and safe, preferably outside of the GitHub repository for security reasons.* 

Additional info on setting up configuration files can be found in the [Configuration file guide](https://sfregosi.github.io/agate/configuration.html).

### Set up folder structure

The suggested folder structure for working with __*agate*__ is to specify a 'mission' folder, and then within that have a standardized set of nested folders for the various __*agate*__ inputs and outputs. The path of the 'mission' folder is specified by `CONFIG.path.mission` in the [mission configuration file](#mission-configuration-file) and typically follows the Seaglider naming scheme (*e.g.*, `C:\Users\User.Name\Desktop\sg###_Location_MonYYYY`). 

Within that, should be a `flightStatus` and a `basestationFiles` folder; `flightStatus` will house output figures and tables created during a mission, and `basestationFiles` is where downloaded basestation files will be saved. 

Additionally there should be a `profiles` folder that will house output tables and plots created during post-mission processing.

These folders can be set up manually, or created in MATLAB: 

```matlab
% specify the local piloting/mission folder for this deployment
path_bsLocal = fullfile(CONFIG.path.mission, 'basestationFiles'); % local copy of basestation files

% make the dirs if they don't exist
mkdir(path_bsLocal);
mkdir(fullfile(CONFIG.path.mission, 'flightStatus'); % where to store status outputs );
mkdir(fullfile(CONFIG.path.mission, 'profiles')); % where to store post-
```

### Initialize __*agate*__

- Open MATLAB
- Add the `agate` folder to the path (with subfolders), if not already done
- Type `CONFIG = agate(<agate_config.cnf>);` in the command window and hit enter
  - Replace `<agate_config.cnf>` with the name of your configuration file (*e.g.*, `'agate_config_sg639_testData_Sep2024.cnf'`)
  - If the configuration file is located within the `agate/settings` folder, just the name is sufficient. If it is located elsewhere, specify the fullfile path (*e.g.*, `'C:/Users/User.Name/Desktop/agate_config_sgXXX.cnf'`)
- Alternatively, simply type `CONFIG = agate;` and you will be prompted to select a configuration file

```matlab
% make sure the agate folder has been added to the path!

% initialize by specifying the configuration file
CONFIG = agate('agate_config.cnf');

% OR intialize and select the configuration file
CONFIG = agate;
```

### Download all basestation files

Use `downloadBasestationFiles` to automatically download various basestation files to a local machine for further examination. This function requires both a mission configuration file and a [basestation configuration file](configuration.qmd#basestation-configuration-file) that contains the host url, username, and either a password or paths to an SSH key pair. 

Below is example code to run this step. This can be saved as a script that makes it easy to re-run each time the glider surfaces, or it can be typed directly into the MATLAB Command Window. The folder structure above must be set up already. 


```matlab
% initialize agate as above

% make sure the folder structure has been set up to have a mission folder that contains subdirectories 'basestationFiles', 'flightStatus', and 'profiles'

% download basestation files
downloadBasetationFiles(CONFIG)

```

### Extract select piloting parameters and flight metrics

```matlab
%% extract various piloting parameters and values reported by .log file
pp = extractPilotingParams(CONFIG, path_bsLocal, path_status, 0);
% the last argument (0) indicates that you don't want to preload an existing pp 
% variable that has been saved as a .mat file. Preloading saves time, but should
% be set to 0 the first time through. Change to 1 after an existing `pp` 
% variable has been saved

% print errors for quick glance/check
pp.ERRORS(end)

% save as .xlsx and .mat 
writetable(pp, fullfile(path_status, ['diveTracking_' CONFIG.glider '.xlsx'])); % local copy
save(fullfile(path_status, ['diveTracking_' CONFIG.glider '.mat']), 'pp');

```
