The Seaglider can be equipped with a variety of acoustic systems. Two - the PMARXL and WISPR systems - both record raw data as .dat files that need to be converted to `.wav` or `.flac` for analysis. __*agate*__ includes conversion utilities for both systems. Example workflows for each system are provided in the `agate\example_workflows` folder and detailed instructions are below.

Additionally, following a mission in Spring 2023, a bug in the WISPR firmware was discovered that led to variable gain over the duration of the deployment. We developed a systematic way to 'fix' this gain in an attempt to standardize it across all files. In the name of posterity, that process is documented on the [WISPR gain fix](wispr-gain-fix.qmd) page.

## Convert WISPR raw files

#### Dependency references

Embedded Ocean Systems, the WISPR developer, has MATLAB and Python tools to work with raw WISPR data. These tools can be found on GitHub - [wispr3](https://github.com/embeddedocean/wispr3). 

Some pieces of the MATLAB tools have been modified to better interface with __*agate*__. Those modified functions are included within __*agate*__ but more detailed info on the modifications can be found in a forked version: [selenefregosi-noaa/wispr3 sf branch](https://github.com/selenefregosi-noaa/wispr3/tree/sf). 

An __*agate*__ user does not need to download or clone these repositories for the below conversion to work, but these links are provided for reference.

#### Example workflow

See `workflow_processWISPR.m` in the `example_workflows` folder for the basic lines needed to convert a directory (that can include subdirectories) of WISPR `.dat` files into either `.flac` or `.wav` files. 

Like other workflows in __*agate*__ it must first be initialized with a mission-level configuration file (*e.g.*, [`agate_config_example.cnf`](https://github.com/sfregosi/agate/blob/main/agate/settings/agate_config_example.cnf)). Only the top `REQUIRED` and `CONFIG.ws` settings in the `OPTIONAL - acoustics` sections of the configuration file are needed for file conversion.

```{default}

% add agate to the path
addpath(genpath('C:\Users\User.Name\Documents\MATLAB\agate'))

% initialize agate
% make sure configuration file now has updated WISPR Settings section
% (not required during mission so may not be set yet)
CONFIG = agate('agate_mission_config.cnf');

```

The `convertWispr` function will actually run the conversion. The output file type is set with the `'outExt'` argument; it can be either `'.flac'` or `'.wav'`. Setting the `'showProgress'` argument to `true` will print each file name to the Command Window as it is processed. This information is automatically also stored in a log file called `conversionLog.txt` that is saved in the output folder. The log will track the start and end time and state if any files have to be skipped due to being invalid/empty. 

```{default}

% process all the files!
convertWispr(CONFIG, 'showProgress', true, 'outExt', '.flac');

```

If the process is interrupted at any point, it is possible to restart at a specified subdirectory. WISPR typically saves raw `.dat` files in folders by date, so enter the name of the dated subdirectory as a string to restart there. It will start at the beginning of the directory so any already processed files in that folder will just be reprocessed. Note that the `fileheaders.txt` file will just append after the restart so some file headers will be repeated. It is possible to just manually delete the to-be-reprocessed files from `fileheaders.txt` if you don't want any duplicates. 

```{default}
% restart the process at folder 240919
convertWispr(CONFIG, 'showProgress', true, 'outExt', '.flac', ...
    'restartDir', '240919');
```

## Convert PMAR raw files

#### Dependency references

A function-ized and modified version of the `convertPmar.m` script and associated function `pmarIn` (written by Dave Mellinger and available in the Mathworks File Exchange: [convertPmar](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/107245-convert-seaglider-pmar-xl-sound-files-to-wav-format)) are included in __*agate*__. 

#### Example workflow

The script and function have been modified and combined to work within the agate toolbox. The input CONFIG files are populated from a PMAR-specific configuration (.cnf) file. An example can be found in the agate/settings folder.

See [`workflow_convertPMAR.m`](https://github.com/sfregosi/agate/blob/main/agate/example_workflows/workflow_convertPMAR.m) in the `example_workflows` folder for a simple example workflow for converting a mission's PMAR `.dat` files to `.wav`. 

Like other workflows in __*agate*__ it must first be initialized with a mission-level configuration file (*e.g.*, [`agate_config_example.cnf`]( https://github.com/sfregosi/agate/blob/main/agate/settings/agate_config_example.cnf)). Only the top `REQUIRED` and `CONFIG.pm` settings in the `OPTIONAL - acoustics` sections of the configuration file are needed for file conversion. 

Additionally, a PMAR conversion configuration file (*e.g.*, [`pmarConvert_example.cnf`](https://github.com/sfregosi/agate/blob/main/agate/settings/pmarConvert_example.cnf)) is needed. This contains the specific paths and is where you can set your desired conversion settings. Detailed descriptions of each parameter setting are in the example configuration file or can be found on the [Configuration - PMAR conversion](./configuration.html#pmar-conversion-configuration-file) page.
