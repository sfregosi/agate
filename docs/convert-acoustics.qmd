__*agate*__ includes utilities for converting raw acoustic files (`.dat`) recorded with either the PMARXL or WISPR acoustic systems into a more easily readable `.wav` or `.flac` format. Example workflows for each system are provided in the `agate\example_workflows` folder and detailed instructions are below.

## WISPR2 gain bug

Following a Seaglider mission in Spring 2023, a bug in the WISPR2 firmware was discovered that led to variable gain over the duration of the deployment. We developed a systematic way to 'fix' this gain in an attempt to standardize it across all files. In the name of posterity, that process is documented on the [WISPR gain fix](wispr-gain-fix.qmd) page.

## Convert WISPR raw files

#### Dependency references

Embedded Ocean Systems, the WISPR developer, has MATLAB and Python tools to work with raw WISPR data available on GitHub: [wispr3](https://github.com/embeddedocean/wispr3). An __*agate*__ user does not need to download or clone this repository but the link is provided here for reference.

Some functions from [wispr3](https://github.com/embeddedocean/wispr3) have been modified to better interface with __*agate*__; the modified functions are included within __*agate*__ and more detailed info on the modifications can be found in a forked version: [sfregosi-noaa/wispr3 sf branch](https://github.com/sfregosi-noaa/wispr3/tree/sf). 

### Example workflow

See `workflow_convertWISPR.m` in the `example_workflows` folder for the basic steps needed to convert a directory (that can include subdirectories) of Seaglider-collected WISPR `.dat` files into either `.flac` or `.wav` files.

## Oceanscout or Slocum gliders

Use the `workflow_convertWISPR_hefring.m` script for a simplified example to convert WISPR data collected by a Hefring Oceanscout or TWR Slocum glider. This workflow uses a blank or very basic configuration file and ignores some Seaglider specific settings.
:::

Like other example workflows, __*agate*__ must first be initialized with a mission-level configuration file (*e.g.*, [`agate_config_example.cnf`](https://github.com/sfregosi/agate/blob/main/agate/settings/agate_config_example.cnf)). For the task of converting WISPR files, this can be empty. Optionally set `CONFIG.ws.inDir` and `CONFIG.ws.outDir` in the `OPTIONAL - acoustics` sections to streamline processing and skip manual selection of the input/output folders.

```{default}
% add agate to the path
addpath(genpath('C:\Users\User.Name\Documents\MATLAB\agate'))

% initialize agate
% use a configuration file with at least CONFIG.ws.inDir and CONFIG.ws.outDir set
CONFIG = agate('agate_mission_config.cnf');

```

Use the `convertWispr` function to run the conversion. The output file type is set with the `'outExt'` argument; it can be either `'.flac'` or `'.wav'`. Set the `'showProgress'` argument to `true` to print each file name to the Command Window as it is processed. This information is automatically stored in a log file called `conversionLog.txt` that is saved in the output folder. The log tracks the processing start and end time and will record any files that have to be skipped due to being invalid/empty. 

```{default}
% process all the files!
convertWispr(CONFIG, 'showProgress', true, 'outExt', '.flac');

```

If the process is interrupted at any point, it is possible to restart at a specified subdirectory. WISPR typically saves raw `.dat` files in folders by date, named with date in the format `YYMMDD`, so enter the name of the dated subdirectory as a six digit string to restart there. It will start at the beginning of the directory so any already processed files in that folder will just be reprocessed. Note that the `fileheaders.txt` file will just append after the restart so some file headers will be repeated. It is possible to just manually delete the to-be-reprocessed files from `fileheaders.txt` if you don't want any duplicates.

```{default}
% restart the process at folder 240919
convertWispr(CONFIG, 'showProgress', true, 'outExt', '.flac', ...
    'restartDir', '240919');
```

## Convert PMAR raw files

#### Dependency references

A function-ized and modified version of the `convertPmar.m` script and associated function `pmarIn` (written by Dave Mellinger and available in the Mathworks File Exchange: [convertPmar](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/107245-convert-seaglider-pmar-xl-sound-files-to-wav-format)) are included in __*agate*__. 

#### Example workflow

The script and function have been modified and combined to work within the agate toolbox. The input CONFIG files are populated from a PMAR-specific configuration (.cnf) file. An example can be found in the agate/settings folder.

See [`workflow_convertPMAR.m`](https://github.com/sfregosi/agate/blob/main/agate/example_workflows/workflow_convertPMAR.m) in the `example_workflows` folder for a simple example workflow for converting a mission's PMAR `.dat` files to `.wav`. 

Like other workflows in __*agate*__ it must first be initialized with a mission-level configuration file (*e.g.*, [`agate_config_example.cnf`]( https://github.com/sfregosi/agate/blob/main/agate/settings/agate_config_example.cnf)). Only the top `REQUIRED` and `CONFIG.pm` settings in the `OPTIONAL - acoustics` sections of the configuration file are needed for file conversion. 

Additionally, a PMAR conversion configuration file (*e.g.*, [`pmarConvert_example.cnf`](https://github.com/sfregosi/agate/blob/main/agate/settings/pmarConvert_example.cnf)) is needed. This contains the specific paths and is where you can set your desired conversion settings. Detailed descriptions of each parameter setting are in the example configuration file or can be found on the [Configuration - PMAR conversion](./configuration.html#pmar-conversion-configuration-file) page.
