My hope is that I will maintain a [stable release](https://github.com/sfregosi/agate/releases) and then for those interested in the latest functionality, the GitHub repository can be cloned. For those interested in [contributing](contribute.html) to the package, I suggest creating a fork and using pull requests to contribute. Please contact me if you have any questions, feedback, or suggestions!\n\nselene [dot] fregosi [at] noaa.gov or [report an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/sfregosi/agate/issues/new){target='_blank'}\n\n## Background\n\nThese tools were initially developed for use with passive acoustic glider surveys conducted by the [OSU/NOAA CIMERS Bioacoustics Lab](https://cimers.oregonstate.edu/our-research){index='_blank'}. Initial development was for surveys using Seaglider platforms and either the Wideband Intelligent Signal Processor and Recorder (WISPR) or the Passive Miniaturized Acoustic Recorder XL (PMARXL) recording systems. \n\nNOAA's [Uncrewed Systems Operations Center (UxSOC)](https://www.omao.noaa.gov/uncrewed-systems/about-noaa-uncrewed-systems-operations) funded additional development into a more broadly applicable and user-friendly tool box that could be used by all interested in conducting glider-based passive acoustic surveys for marine mammals. \n\n**Ready? [Get started](get-started.qmd)**\n\n![Diagram showing the different components of __*agate*__. Tools can be broken up into two main categories: piloting tools, which are used for survey planning and execution, and processing tools which are used in post-mission analyses. The processing tools can further be broken up into flight, acoustic, and cetacean encounter processing tools. The cetacean encounter processing tools can incorporate externally identified cetacean detections (white balloon) or process on-board detections if available.](images/agate_workflow_2024-08-09.png){#fig-components width=75%}\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThis code was either developed or most recently updated and tested with MATLAB version 2022b, but has undergone some testing with 2020b.  \n\n#### MATLAB toolboxes\n\n- Mapping Toolbox  \n__*agate*__ requires the MATLAB Mapping toolbox. In the future, we may try modify the mapping tools to work with the freely available `m_map` package to make it more accessible, but are not there yet!\n\n#### MATLAB File Exchange\n\nThis package requires a few resources from MATLAB File Exchange. They come packaged within the `utils/fileExchange` folder.

Detailed basemaps are available from [NCEI](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/etopo-global-relief-model).  \n\nThere are tradeoffs in the resolution of basemap raster selected.\n\n- High resolution basemaps are necessary for fine-scale piloting to ensure the glider does not hit the bottom, but they require manual export of a .tiff from NCEI. 15 arc second is the finest resolution option and can be extracted for the specific area of interest using the [ETOPO Grid Extract tool](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/maps/grid-extract/). The smaller the area extracted, the faster it will load and plot. \n- Lower resolution may be sufficient for post-mission plotting. The global 60 arc second tiff is a good mid-resolution option that is easy, although slow, to download, import, and plot. Alternatively, 60 arc second resolution for just a specific area of interest can be extracted with the [ETOPO Grid Extract tool](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/maps/grid-extract/) providing a smaller file size and faster loading/plotting. \n\n## Test dataset \n\nA small example test dataset for a WISPR-equipped Seaglider is available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YZqnzZEor6v1lGQPB4EQll3-U2lfSh8n?usp=sharing). The test dataset includes Seaglider flight files for 10 dives and 10 minutes of raw WISPR acoustic files to test the setup and functionality of __*agate*__. \n\n## Disclaimer\n\n<sub>The scientific results and conclusions, as well as any views or opinions expressed herein, are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of NOAA or the Department of Commerce.</sub>\n\n<sub>This repository is a scientific product and is not official communication of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or the United States Department of Commerce.
