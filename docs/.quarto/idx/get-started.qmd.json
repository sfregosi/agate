Both of these are plain text files that end with .cnf and can be edited in any text editor or in MATLAB's Editor window\n\n1. An overview [mission configuration file](#mission-configuration-file) for a specific glider/mission\n2. A [basestation configuration file](#basestation-configuration-file) with SSH login info\n\n#### Mission configuration file\n\nAn example configuration file is located in the `agate/settings` folder: [`agate_config_example.cnf`](https://github.com/sfregosi/agate/blob/main/agate/settings/agate_config_example.cnf)\n\nThe configuration file has settings for the glider and mission, paths to relevant input and output folders, map extent and plotting settings, and acoustic system settings. The top section is required to initialize __*agate*__ and use the most basic functions. The remaining sections are optional depending on what __*agate*__ functionality is desired. Make a copy and save this file with a unique name for each glider and mission. Descriptions of each configuration item are included in the example file as comments that start with `%`. \n\nAdditional info on setting up configuration files can be found in the [Configuration file guide](https://sfregosi.github.io/agate/configuration.html).\n\nTo suggest additional configuration items, please open an [issue](https://github.com/sfregosi/agate/issues/new){target='_blank'}.\n\n#### Basestation configuration file\n\nThe path and filename for a basestation configuration file is specified in the mission configuration file. An example is located in the `agate/settings` folder: [`basestation_example.cnf`](https://github.com/sfregosi/agate/blob/main/agate/settings/basestation_example.cnf). \n\nThis is a separate configuration file that typically does not change between missions and gliders, and contains potentially sensitive information for the SSH connection to a research group's basestation. *This file should be stored somewhere central and safe, preferably outside of the GitHub repository for security reasons.* \n\nAdditional info on setting up configuration files can be found in the [Configuration file guide](https://sfregosi.github.io/agate/configuration.html).\n\n<sub>[Back to top](#)</sub>\n\n### Set up folder structure\n\nThe suggested folder structure for working with __*agate*__ is to specify a 'mission' folder, and then within that have a standardized set of nested folders for the various __*agate*__ inputs and outputs. The path of the 'mission' folder is specified by `CONFIG.path.mission` in the [mission configuration file](#mission-configuration-file) and typically follows the Seaglider naming scheme (*e.g.*, `C:\\Users\\User.Name\\Desktop\\sg###_Location_MonYYYY`). \n\nWithin that, should be a `flightStatus` and a `basestationFiles` folder; `flightStatus` will house output figures and tables, and `basestationFiles` is where downloaded basestation files will be saved. \n\nThese folders can be set up manually, or created in MATLAB: \n\n```matlab\n% specify the local piloting folder for this trip\npath_status = fullfile(CONFIG.path.mission, 'flightStatus'); % where to store status outputs \npath_bsLocal = fullfile(CONFIG.path.mission, 'basestationFiles'); % local copy of basestation files\n\n% make the dirs if they don't exist\nmkdir(path_status);\nmkdir(path_bsLocal);\n```\n\n<sub>[Back to top](#)</sub>\n\n### Initialize __*agate*__\n\n- Open MATLAB\n- Add the `agate` folder to the path (with subfolders), if not already done\n- Type `CONFIG = agate(<agate_config.cnf>);` in the command window and hit enter\n  - Replace `<agate_config.cnf>` with the name of your configuration file (*e.g.*, `'agate_config_sg639_MHI_Apr2022.cnf'`)\n  - If the configuration file is located within the `agate/settings` folder, just the name is sufficient. If it is located elsewhere, specify the fullfile path (*e.g.*, `'C:/Users/User.Name/Desktop/agate_config_sgXXX.cnf'`)\n- Alternatively, simply type `CONFIG = agate;` and you will be prompted to select a configuration file\n\n```matlab\n% make sure the agate folder has been added to the path!\n\n% initialize by specifying the configuration file\nCONFIG = agate('agate_config.cnf');\n\n% OR intialize and select the configuration file\nCONFIG = agate;\n```\n\n<sub>[Back to top](#)</sub>\n\n### Download all basestation files\n\nUse `downloadBasestationFiles` to automatically download various basestation files to a local machine for further examination. This function requires both a mission configuration file and a [basestation configuration file](configuration.qmd#basestation-configuration-file) that contains the host url, username, and either a password or paths to an SSH key pair. \n\nBelow is example code to run this step. This can be saved as a script that makes it easy to re-run each time the glider surfaces, or it can be typed directly into the MATLAB Command Window. \n\n\n```matlab\n% initialize agate as above\n\n% specify the local basestation and status/output folder for this mission\npath_status = fullfile(CONFIG.path.mission, 'flightStatus'); % where to store status outputs \npath_bsLocal = fullfile(CONFIG.path.mission, 'basestationFiles'); % local copy of basestation files - this can be defined in the configuation file as CONFIG.path.bsLocal\n\n% make the dirs if they don't exist\nmkdir(path_status);\nmkdir(path_bsLocal); % OR mkdir(CONFIG.path.bsLocal);\n\n% download basestation files\ndownloadBasetationFiles(CONFIG)\n\n```\n\n<sub>[Back to top](#)</sub>\n\n### Extract select piloting parameters and flight metrics\n\n```matlab\n%% extract various piloting parameters and values reported by .log file\npp = extractPilotingParams(CONFIG, path_bsLocal, path_status, 0);\n% the last argument (0) indicates that you don't want to preload an existing pp \n% variable that has been saved as a .mat file. Preloading saves time, but should\n% be set to 0 the first time through. Change to 1 after an existing `pp` \n% variable has been saved\n\n% print errors for quick glance/check\npp.ERRORS(end)\n\n% save as .xlsx and .mat \nwritetable(pp, fullfile(path_status, ['diveTracking_' CONFIG.glider '.xlsx'])); % local copy\nsave(fullfile(path_status, ['diveTracking_' CONFIG.glider '.mat']), 'pp');\n\n```\n\n<sub>[Back to top](#)</sub>\n\n\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r, include = FALSE}\nlibrary(fontawesome)\n```\n\nThis page is meant to help with __*agate*__ 'installation' on your MATLAB path and setting up the necessary configuration files and folder structure plus serve as a quick start guide for some basic commands. \n\nThis page is not a detailed list of all available functions and their specific documentation (that might be coming later!).
